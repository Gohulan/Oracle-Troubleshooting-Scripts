**Oracle Simphony POS Troubleshooting Scripts**

Welcome to the Oracle Simphony POS Troubleshooting repository! This repository contains a collection of useful SQL scripts, queries, and documentation aimed at assisting developers, database administrators, and support engineers in troubleshooting Oracle Simphony Point-of-Sale (POS) systems.

**Disclaimer:**
Creating a user with privileges similar to the SYS user is not recommended. The SYS user is highly privileged and reserved for database administration tasks only. It can pose security risks and harm the database. For administrative tasks, it is better to create a new user and grant specific privileges based on the required tasks.

**Scripts Overview:**

1) **Identify Locked Sessions and Blocking Locks:** Helps identify sessions holding locks and those being blocked, aiding in resolving concurrency issues.

2) **Check Database Performance and Wait Events:** Monitors database performance by analyzing wait events and addressing performance bottlenecks.

3) **Find High-CPU-Consuming SQL Statements:** Pinpoints CPU-intensive SQL statements for query optimization and system tuning.

4) **Identify Space Usage for Tables and Indexes:** Assesses space usage for tables and indexes, managing storage efficiently.

5) **Check for Long-Running Queries:** Detects long-running SQL queries to optimize query execution plans.

6) **Analyze Table and Index Statistics:** Gathers statistics to improve query optimization and overall database performance.

7) **Check Database Health:** Retrieves essential database and instance information to ensure system stability.

8) **Identify Temp Space Usage:** Monitors temporary tablespace usage to prevent temporary space-related issues.

9) **Check for Invalid Objects:** Identifies and resolves invalid database objects for enhanced stability.

10) **Monitor Table Locks and Wait Events:** Manages table locks and wait events for a smoothly running database.

**Contribution:**
I encourage contributions to enhance this repository. If you encounter new troubleshooting scenarios or have additional scripts to share, please create pull requests. Always review and understand the scripts before running them in production environments.

Please use these scripts responsibly and exercise caution while executing them. Improper usage can cause unintended consequences. Always have proper backups and test scripts in a controlled environment before applying them to production.
